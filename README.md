Hi! I'm an engineer at Gusto working on products for accountants. I used to build tools for grid-scale energy storage revenue optimization at Southern California Edison.

I also sometimes build things on my own time, like [Virgil](https://github.com/kevinkoste/virgil) and [blobber](https://github.com/kevinkoste/blobber).

Please [get in touch](mailto:kevinkoste@gmail.com) if you'd like to collaborate!
