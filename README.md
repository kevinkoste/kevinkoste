Hi! I'm a full stack engineer and energy market analyst at Southern California Edison, where I build revenue optimization software for energy storage assets.

On nights and weekends I build consumer products and developer tools like [Virgil](https://github.com/kevinkoste/virgil) and [Blobber](https://github.com/kevinkoste/blobber).

I primarily work at the application layer using technologies like React, React Native, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Flask, MongoDB, and Postgres.
At Edison, I build and maintain Python data analytics tools that make heavy use of [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming).

Please [get in touch](mailto:kevinkoste@gmail.com) if you'd like to collaborate!
