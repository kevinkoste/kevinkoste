### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm a full-stack engineer and energy market analyst at Southern California Edison, where I build revenue optimization software for energy storage assets.

On nights and weekends, I build consumer products & developer tools like [Virgil](https://github.com/kevinkoste/virgil-mobile-app) and [Blobber](https://github.com/kevinkoste/blobber).
