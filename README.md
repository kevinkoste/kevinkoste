Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a full-stack engineer and energy market analyst at Southern California Edison, where I build revenue optimization software for energy storage assets.

On nights and weekends, I build consumer products & developer tools like [Virgil](https://github.com/kevinkoste/virgil-mobile-app) and [Blobber](https://github.com/kevinkoste/blobber).

I primarily work at the application layer using technologies like React (with TypeScript :heart:), Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js/Express, MongoDB, and Postgres.
At Edison, I build Python applications that make heavy use of [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) to optimize energy storage & demand response market performance.

Please [get in touch](mailto:kevinkoste@gmail.com) if you'd like to collaborate or hire me!
